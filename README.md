# Weatherapp

This project is a demonstration of a simple app comparing the weather between two cities. It pulls data from the [OpenWeatherMap API](http://openweathermap.org/api).

## Installation

1. Pull this repo
2. Run ```npm install``` and ```bower install``` to pull required modules & components
	* Optionally change the API key in js/main.js to your own API key
3. Run ```gulp serve``` to start the app on localhost:4444

## TODO

- [ ] Add unrequired node_modules and bower_components directories to .gitignore

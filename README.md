# Weatherapp

This project is a demonstration of a simple app comparing the weather between two cities. It pulls data from the [OpenWeatherMap API](http://openweathermap.org/api).

## Description

As stated above, this project is a simple application of the OpenWeatherMap API. Two input boxes provide the ability to search for two cities to compare, defaulting to London and New York. The current weather metrics are shown below these inputs in tabular form by default. Two buttons in this section allow this table to toggle between current metrics and a 7-day forecast.

The lower section displays an interactive chart which defaults to showing a forecast for the next 7-day period for temperature. Three buttons in this section allow toggling between temperature, atmosperic conditions (cloud cover and snow), and wind. The chart combines information from both cities. A control is available under the chart to control the time range for this information. Time permitting, this will be expanded to allow viewing of historical weather data from the past month. 

Several options for configuration are available under the gear icon in the header. These options include unit conversion, layout, and themeing. 

## Installation

1. Pull this repo
2. Run ```npm install``` and ```bower install``` to pull required modules & components
	* Optionally change the API key in js/main.js to your own API key
3. Run ```gulp serve``` to start the app on localhost:4444

## TODO

- [ ] Add unrequired node_modules and bower_components directories to .gitignore
- [ ] Create a distribution build with concat'd/min'd/uglify'd files
- [ ] Create an interactive chart using d3, c3, or the google charting API
- [ ] Adjust the tooltip styles to reflect the selected theme
- [ ] Verify Browser support
- [ ] Use promises in a more generic way in resolving lat/long coordinates and states
